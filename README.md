# CS-320-Portfolio
This is the journal entry for the SNHU class CS 320. The journal will have a readme file answering questions required and a copy of the project used.

1.	Testing is the main way to ensure that your code is functional. It allows you to test features automatically as if the user did inputs. This has some flaws, but it helps speed the process along.
2.	I ask questions. The more data gathered the more you can tailor a program to someone’s needs. It’s also in how you ask the questions. There are many ways of asking questions and depending on how you do them the client may be more or less receptive.
3.	I approach software design from a logical viewpoint. I appreciate efficiency and write code with simplicity in mind. Why write 5 extra lines when 2 will do. I may not write the most efficient, but I try.
